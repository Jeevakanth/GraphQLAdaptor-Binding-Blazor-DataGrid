# GraphQLAdaptor-Binding-Blazor-DataGrid

GraphQL is a query language for APIs with which you can get exactly what you need and nothing more. The GraphQLAdaptor provides an option to retrieve data from the GraphQL server. You can also perform CRUD and data operations like paging, sorting, filtering etc by sending the required arguments to the server.

## Steps to run the project

1. First run the ASPNetCoreGraphQlServer application which is the GraphQL server.
2. Now run the BlazorApplication in which data is bounded to the grid component by using the DataManager's GraphQL adaptor.

### Note

You can run the GraphQL server using the Banana Cake Pop IDE, which you can download from [here](https://chillicream.com/products/bananacakepop/). Alternatively, you can use any other IDE that supports running GraphQL queries.
